Week 3
Change words_prompt to rely on the sql db

* Fix the magic constants in word_prompt

* Change get_row_10_words to something that makes more sense

* Use useroption (main.py) words to present sentence to user

* Stats.py ( make class with functions that will compile the statistics and give to the db)

* Assume we have X… assume we have Y … make sure its used as a module

* Make tests for stats.py ( the point of TDD is to do the tests first)

* Outline the API … print the function header and pass the function

* unittest — Unit testing framework — Python 3.9.6 documentation <- use class and a test/stats_test.py!
